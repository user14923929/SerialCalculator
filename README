# Serial Calculator

This Arduino project allows you to perform basic arithmetic and trigonometric calculations via the Serial Monitor.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Displays results on an LCD screen.
- Handles division by zero and invalid input gracefully.

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.

## Usage

1. Upload the `SerialCalculator.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE.
3. Set the baud rate to 9600.
4. Enter an expression in the following formats:
    - Arithmetic: `5+3`, `10-2`, `4*7`, `8/2`
    - Trigonometric: `sin(30)`, `cos(45)`, `tan(60)`
